Experimenting with Pandas.

## Getting Started

-   First go ahead and unzip the data.zip file and make sure that the csv name is "data.csv"

*   Once completed, go to line 75 and change the name paramater to be "data.csv"
*   Then run the following command

```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python app.py
```

Side note: If you want to test with other data sets, you can just import the "TemperatureStation" class and follow along with the main() method on line 73.
